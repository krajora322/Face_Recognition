# Face_Recognition
In this python project, I have made an attendance system which takes attendance by using face recognition technique.

Attendance Management System is an application developed for daily student attendance in colleges or. schools. This project attempts to record attendance through face detection.

This System uses facial recognition technology to record the attendance through a high resolution digital camera/webcam that detects and recognizes faces and compare the recognize faces with students/known faces images stored in faces database(CSV).

TECHNOLOGY USED:

OpenCV for taking images and face recognition

CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime etc. for other purposes.
